# Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio!
I am a budding data analyst with project expierience using various tools to collect, clean, transform, analyze and visualize large complex data sets to help inform business decisions. I am competent in SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau. I am currently learning Google BigQuery, PowerBI, and PowerQuery to improve my analyst skills. I have a good understanding of data anlytics techniques such as dashboard building, report generation, data merging and transformation, statistics and critical thinking.

In this project portfolio, I have included several projects that showcase my data analytics skills. I hope that these projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and concise manner that is also visually appealling. This should make it easier for decision makers to to understand the data insights and take action.

I have included my work in programming languages such as Python and SQL. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging!
